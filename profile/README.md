 Congratulations on finding your way to the greatest hash-cracking adventure of the eon. The Jabbercracky is a community hash cracking hub for people of all skill levels.

We host realistic time-locked password cracking events designed to be fun and competitive for the cybersecurity and cryptographic communities with an arcade inspired theme. All hashes are 100% artificial and generated by us for safe competition. When events are not active, all lists are available for practice to help level up your skill set. 

New competitions are often, and the next event is always on the horizon.
