# Huzzah!
Congratulations on finding your way to the greatest hash-cracking adventure of the eon. The Jabbercracky is a community hash cracking event for people of all skill levels.

Jabbercracky is a community hash-cracking site designed for people of all skill levels. Seasonally, the Jabbercracky team hosts hash-cracking events, where we provide several created hash challenges for players to crack. When the events are not active, players can practice cracking past hash lists and continue to earn points and loot.

New competitions are often, and the next event is always on the horizon.
